Captain Falcon is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. Melee.
Falcon currently ranks 7th place on the Melee tier list. He still ranks rather high like in the Smash 64 tier list because he retains his incredible comboing abilities; he has a fast falling speed and air speed, and the fastest dash of all characters, giving him one of the best SHFFLs in the game. His high weight and fast falling speed also make him the character most resistant to vertical KOs. His speed, fast rolls, and Raptor Boost enable an excellent dodging and tech-chasing game. Falcon also has multiple quick KO moves, most notably his Knee Smash, forward smash, and his nipple spike, all of which can be combo finishers. Against high-tiered opponents, however, Falcon is susceptible to chaingrabs and combos due to his high falling speed. He is also prone to edgeguarding, since he has a predictable recovery that, like in Smash 64, cannot grab ledge-hanging enemies. Falcon lacks a projectile, impairing his approach in some matchups, while most of his attacks have long start-up. Regardless of his weaknesses, Captain Falcon still has an impressive number of winning matchups, including six that are near-unloseable.
